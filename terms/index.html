			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					Physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
				</li>

				</li>
				<li>
					The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the complaining party;
				</li>

Notices and counter-notices must meet current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices under the DMCA, as well as all other communications addressed to us relating to these Terms of Use, should be sent c/o Morrison-Tenenbaum, PLLC, 87 Walker Street, Second Floor, New York, NY 10013.
